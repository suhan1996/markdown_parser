Wechaty can implement many wechat protocol plughins. The plugins are the component that helps Wechaty to control the Wechat. Wechaty provide same API in web, ipad, ios solutions. [wechat4u](https://github.com/nodeWechat/wechat4u) is [SPACELAN](https://github.com/spacelan) write as a web solution on github. Wechaty can use wechaty API call wechat 4u API

> Is this right: wechaty has All api in wechat4u, but wechat 4u don't have all api wechaty has.
